    "## Background and Definition of the Dzhanibekov Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dzhanibekov effect, tennis racket theorem or intermediate axis theorem is named after the Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, who discovered it aboard the MIR space station in 1985. The phoneomenon discovered was related to the motion of a nut rotating in microgravity after being unscrewed when unpacking cargo. The nut began rotating with seemingly stable motion for some time, until it flipped on its axis and began rotating again. This was a repeating sequence, indicating that the rotation was not stable at all. [[1]](#ref1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise this instability, the example of a spinning T-handle on the International Space Station is shown in the video below. The T-handle is an example of an asymmetric object subject to the Dzhanibekov effect, in free-floating rotation, exhibiting a bi-stable state due to intermediate moments of inertia. \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When an asymmetric object rotates around its intermediate principal axis, an inherent instability arises. This occurs because a rigid body has three principal moments of inertia, which influence its rotational motion. While rotation around the first and third principal axes can be stable, the second principal axis (the intermediate axis) is inherently unstable [[2]](#ref2). The diagram below illustrates the principal axes nad their stability: \n",

    "## Mathematical Framework\n",
    "To further analyse this effect, we need to focus on how to mathmatically define a particular bodies attitude. The attitude of a body is its orientation in space. Traditionally, euler angles and quaternions are used to define the equatuions of motion for a rigid body - each with unique properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euler Angles\n",
    "Euler angles have been widely used in vehicle dynamics since their introduction in the late 1700s to parameterize rotations. Parameterizing a rotation refers to describing the orientation of a rotating object or coordinate system in a mathematical framework using specific parameters. Euler angles achieve this by defining a sequence of rotations around the object's principal axes, making them a fundamental tool for analyzing rotational motion in various engineering and scientific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, each Euler angle refers to the rotation (angle) around a specific axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ϕ (phi)**: rotation around the z-axis\n",
    "- **θ (theta)**: rotation around the y-axis\n",
    "- **ψ (psi)**: rotation around the x-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of rotations transforms one reference frame into another, enabling the description of the orientation of a body in three-dimensional space. The order of rotations matters and can lead to different types of Euler angle conventions, such as the ZYX convention, which represents the most common sequence of rotations [[4]](#ref4).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Euler angles are convenient for many applications, they can suffer from **gimbal lock**, a condition where two of the rotational axes become aligned. This alignment causes a loss of one degree of freedom, effectively reducing the system's ability to perform certain rotations and making it challenging to describe certain orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid gimbal lock and overcome the limitations of Euler angles, alternative methods such as quaternions are often used in more complex dynamics and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quaternions\n",
    "Quaternions offer an alternative approach to representing rotations using a four-dimensional vector. They consist of a scalar part and a vector part, allowing for a concise and efficient representation of orientation. Unlike Euler angles, quaternions do not suffer from gimbal lock, making them particularly advantageous for applications requiring continuous rotations and smooth interpolation between orientations (e.g., 3D animations and spacecraft attitude control).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions are widely utilized in modern aerospace systems and robotics for their computational efficiency and robustness in representing orientation changes. They enable sophisticated algorithms such as spherical linear interpolation (SLERP), which ensures seamless transitions between different orientations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further exploration and visualization of quaternions, I would recomend an interactive video series by Grant Sanderson and Ben Eater that can be found at: [eater.net/quaternions](https://eater.net/quaternions)."

For the purposes of this textbook, MATLAB code which functions based on euler angles was created by [Berkeley Mechanical Engineering](#ref2) was then used to transcribe a python simulation based on quaternions.\n",

    "<!-- Used for The Dzhanibekov effect, tennis racket theorem or intermediate axis theorem is named after the Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, who discovered it aboard the MIR space station in 1985. The phoneomenon discovered was related to the motion of a nut rotating in microgravity after being unscrewed when unpacking cargo. The nut began rotating with seemingly stable motion for some time, until it flipped on its axis and began rotating again. This was a repeating sequence, indicating that the rotation was not stable at all.   -->\n",

    "<!-- When an asymmetric object rotates around its intermediate principal axis, an inherent instability arises. This occurs because a rigid body has three principal moments of inertia, which influence its rotational motion. While rotation around the first and third principal axes can be stable, the second principal axis (the intermediate axis) is inherently unstable. The diagram below illustrates the principal axes and their stability:  -->\n",
