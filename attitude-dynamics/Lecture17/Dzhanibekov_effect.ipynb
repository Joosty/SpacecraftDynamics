    "## Background and Definition of the Dzhanibekov Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dzhanibekov effect, tennis racket theorem or intermediate axis theorem is named after the Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Dzhanibekov, who discovered it aboard the MIR space station in 1985. The phoneomenon discovered was related to the motion of a nut rotating in microgravity after being unscrewed when unpacking cargo. The nut began rotating with seemingly stable motion for some time, until it flipped on its axis and began rotating again. This was a repeating sequence, indicating that the rotation was not stable at all. [[1]](#ref1)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise this instability, the example of a spinning T-handle on the International Space Station is shown in the video below. The T-handle is an example of an asymmetric object subject to the Dzhanibekov effect, in free-floating rotation, exhibiting a bi-stable state due to intermediate moments of inertia. \n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "When an asymmetric object rotates around its intermediate principal axis, an inherent instability arises. This occurs because a rigid body has three principal moments of inertia, which influence its rotational motion. While rotation around the first and third principal axes can be stable, the second principal axis (the intermediate axis) is inherently unstable [[2]](#ref2). The diagram below illustrates the principal axes nad their stability: \n",

    "## Mathematical Framework for the Dzhanibekov Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the Dzhanibekov effect, we need to mathematically define a body's attitude (orientation in space). Two main approaches are commonly used: Euler angles and quaternions. Each method has its own strengths and limitations, which we'll explore in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Euler Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler angles have been a cornerstone of rotational dynamics since their introduction in the late 1700s. They parameterize rotations by describing a sequence of rotations around an object's principal axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition and Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, each Euler angle represents a rotation around a specific axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ϕ (phi)**: rotation around the z-axis\n",
    "- **θ (theta)**: rotation around the y-axis\n",
    "- **ψ (psi)**: rotation around the x-axis\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence transforms one reference frame into another, allowing us to describe a body's orientation in three-dimensional space. The order of rotations is crucial and leads to different Euler angle conventions, such as the commonly used ZYX convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Intuitive to understand (represent physical rotations)\n",
    "- Only three parameters needed\n",
    "- Useful for human input/output\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Suffer from gimbal lock (loss of one degree of freedom)\n",
    "- Computationally expensive due to trigonometric functions\n",
    "- Can have singularities\n",
    "- Not unique (multiple representations for the same orientation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of gimbal lock, where two rotational axes align and cause a loss of one degree of freedom, is particularly problematic in complex simulations. This limitation led to the development of alternative representations, such as quaternions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "Quaternions offer an alternative approach to representing rotations using a four-dimensional vector. They consist of a scalar part and a vector part, allowing for a concise and efficient representation of orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A quaternion is a four-dimensional complex number, often written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = w + xi + yj + zk$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are real numbers, and $i$, $j$, and $k$ are imaginary units satisfying:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For representing rotations, we use unit quaternions, where $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$. A rotation of angle $\\theta$ around a unit vector $\\mathbf{u} = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$ is represented by the quaternion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q = \\cos(\\theta/2) + (u_xi + u_yj + u_zk)\\sin(\\theta/2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rotating Vectors with Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "To rotate a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ using a quaternion $q$, we use the operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{v}' = q\\mathbf{v}q^*$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q^*$ is the conjugate of $q$, and the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is treated as a quaternion with zero scalar part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Evolution of Quaternions\n",
    "\n",
    "The time evolution of a quaternion representing the orientation of a rotating body is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{q} = \\frac{1}{2}q\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is treated as a quaternion with zero scalar part.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages and Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- No gimbal lock\n",
    "- Computationally efficient (no trigonometric functions)\n",
    "- Smooth interpolation between orientations\n",
    "- Unique representation (up to sign)\n",
    "- Numerically stable\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Less intuitive to understand\n",
    "- Four parameters needed instead of three\n",
    "- Constraint of unit length needs to be maintained\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Euler's Equations for Rigid Body Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of whether we use Euler angles or quaternions to represent orientation, the fundamental equations governing rigid body rotation remain the same. These are known as Euler's equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the fundamental principle that the rate of change of angular momentum equals the applied torque:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \\mathbf{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{L}$ is the angular momentum and $\\mathbf{N}$ is the applied torque.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a rigid body rotating about its center of mass, the angular momentum is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{L} = \\mathbf{I}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the moment of inertia tensor and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ is the angular velocity vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time derivative of $\\mathbf{L}$ in the body-fixed frame is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \\mathbf{I}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}{dt} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times (\\mathbf{I}\\boldsymbol{\\omega})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equating this to the applied torque and assuming no external torques (free rotation), we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{I}\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}{dt} + \\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times (\\mathbf{I}\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) = \\mathbf{0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the principal axis frame, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is diagonal with elements $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, this equation becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "I_1 \\dot{\\omega}_1 &= (I_2 - I_3)\\omega_2\\omega_3 \\\\\n",
    "I_2 \\dot{\\omega}_2 &= (I_3 - I_1)\\omega_3\\omega_1 \\\\\n",
    "I_3 \\dot{\\omega}_3 &= (I_1 - I_2)\\omega_1\\omega_2\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are Euler's equations for the rotation of a rigid body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Dzhanibekov effect, quaternions are often preferred for numerical simulations due to their computational efficiency and lack of singularities. However, Euler angles can be useful for visualizing and understanding the motion, particularly when describing the \"flip\" that occurs during the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between Euler angles and quaternions often depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. Understanding both approaches provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing complex rotational dynamics like the Dzhanibekov effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further exploration and visualization of quaternions, an interactive video series by Grant Sanderson and Ben Eater is available at: [eater.net/quaternions](https://eater.net/quaternions).\n"

The phoneomenon discovered was related to the motion of a nut rotating in microgravity after being unscrewed when unpacking cargo. The nut began rotating with seemingly stable motion for some time, until it flipped on its axis and began rotating again. This was a repeating sequence, indicating that the rotation was not stable at all.   -->\n",
